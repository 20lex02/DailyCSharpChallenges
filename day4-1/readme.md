## Day 4-1: Simplified Fractions *(very hard)*
Create a function that returns the simplified version of a fraction.

### Examples
* `Simplify("4/6")` -> `"2/3"`
* `Simplify("10/11")` -> `"10/11"`
* `Simplify("100/400")` -> `"1/4"`
* `Simplify("8/4")` -> `"2"`

### Notes
* A fraction is simplified if there are no common factors (except 1) between the numerator and the denominator. For example, `4/6` is not simplified, since 4 and 6 both share `2` as a factor.
* If improper fractions can be transformed into integers, do so in your code (see example #4).
